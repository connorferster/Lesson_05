    "## What is a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a small piece of code that describes a _process_ and is assigned a name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous workbook exercise was just code written in Jupyter cells. If you wanted to run that code in multiple places, you would have to copy and paste the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function allows you to write some code once, and use it multiple times by just calling its name, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def loud_string(s: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Returns the string, 's', as uppercase and with an exclamation point at the end.\"\"\"\n",
    "    loud = f\"{s.upper()}!\"\n",
    "    return loud\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the function has been defined it can be used later in the code and in multiple places:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player_greeting = \"Good morning\"\n",
    "obnoxious_player_greeting = loud_string(player_greeting)\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def loud_string(s: str) -> str:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The signature *defines* the name of the function, tells us what parameters it takes and what type they are, and then tells us what type the function outputs, or *returns*. A good function signature should be able to tell us most of what we need to know about the function without _having_ to read the docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The \"doc string\":\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "The doc string is just a `str` written with three quotes (`\"\"\"`, used for multi-line strings) that tells us what the function does. We can read the doc string of any function in python by typing `help(<function name>)`. e.g. We could type `help(loud_string)` to see the doc string of our function here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The \"implementation\":\n",
    "```python\n",
    "loud = f\"{s.upper()}!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The implementation is what we call the actual lines of code in the function. We call it this because it is the implementation of the *idea* or *purpose* of the function. Often times, there are many ways to implement any given function. The way that it is written is just the _current implementation_.\n",

    "### 4. The `return`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return loud\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**The `return` keyword tells the function to do two things:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Terminate the function\n",
    "2. If there is a variable or _expression_ beside the return keyword, then that value is given as the _output_ or \"return value\" of the function.\n"
